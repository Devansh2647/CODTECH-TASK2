OVERVIEW OF PROJECT 
Building a Serverless Application with AWS Lambda 
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It's a popular choice for building scalable and cost-effective applications.

Key Concepts of Lambda:
Functions: These are the units of code you execute. They can be written in various languages (Python, Node.js, Java, Go, C#, etc.) and triggered by events.
Events: These are occurrences that initiate the execution of a Lambda function. Common events include:
API Gateway: HTTP requests
S3: Object uploads, deletes, or modifications
DynamoDB: Stream events
Kinesis: Data records
CloudWatch Events: Scheduled events or custom rules
Execution Environment: Lambda provides a managed environment where your code runs, including operating system, libraries, and dependencies.
Concurrency: Lambda can scale automatically to handle varying workloads, allowing for high availability.
